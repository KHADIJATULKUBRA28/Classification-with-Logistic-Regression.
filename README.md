Logistic Regression – Breast Cancer Classification

This project uses Logistic Regression to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Tools Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Steps Performed

Loaded and cleaned the dataset
Encoded diagnosis (M=1, B=0)
Scaled features
Trained Logistic Regression
Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC
Plotted Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve
Tuned threshold and explained sigmoid

Model Performance

Accuracy: ~96%
Precision: ~97%
Recall: ~95%
AUC: ~0.99
